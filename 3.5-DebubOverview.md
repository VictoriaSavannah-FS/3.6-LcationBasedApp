# 3.5 DEbug Panel Setup Reflection overview

I was a little lost at first and spent a few minutes trying to update the files to use the error type-safe for their error handleing.

Great tool to have honeslty! I had this exact issue these past few days trying to pinpoint my exact location and kept getting a random or far away location / coordinates for my 3.8 App. I understand it's a little differnt with the iOS simulator, but the web wasn't working. I like that the Dubug panel exports a JSON report that helps you understand and visually see the data that your fetching and what's returning. I can totally see this to check myself and ensuring that I'm targettign the corrct properties within my []'s.

I added a Debug Button to my Maps screen for easy access to the actual Debug Panel. I also noticed that aach test produced three log events - and I thought it was a mistake at first, until I realized upon looking at the code agiain that they were fetching exaclty the data we we're requesting --

- location source
- Weather API request
- Weather API response

```bash
// 1. Log the location ---
locationDebugger.logLocationEvent("manual_location", coords, {
  address,
  errors: ["Manually set location"],
});

// 2. Log the weather request
// --> Before calling @OpenWeather
locationDebugger.logLocationEvent("weather_request", location.coordinates, {
  address: location.address,
  errors: [`Requesting weather for: ${latitude}, ${longitude}`],
});

// 3. Log weather res.
//onl-->  after API return data --
locationDebugger.logLocationEvent("weather_response", responseCoords, {
  address: response.data.name,
  weatherData: {
    location: { name: response.data.name },
    current: { description: response.data.weather[0].description },
  },
});
```

shows the signal flow from initial location, to requesting weather from OpenWeather API from @location, and waitng and displayign the API resposne.
